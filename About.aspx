			<span>Current Crisis</span>
		</div>
		<p>In the modern era of an increasing ecologically conscious consumer base and of Global Warming, 
            businesses can no longer afford to ignore their environmental impacts. In the coming years, Federal and State regulatory bodies will be enforcing ever more stringent laws concerning 
            the production of carbon dioxide, hazardous waste, and other dangerous by-products of the current business paradigm. </p>

			<span>What We Do</span>
		</div>
		<p>Our team of ecological analysts, climatologists, project managers, and environmental lawyers will be dispatched to review operations for a business and will create a report that determines what a business does well (ecologically speaking), and what it does poorly, while also conducting interviews to determine how aware of the ecological impact of the business the employees and managers are aware of.</p>

			<span>How Do We Do IT</span>
		</div>
		<p>The team will then create an action plan to target key areas in the business process that have become particularly troublesome. Businesses seeking to become compliant will likely cost more as it will be more difficult and oftentimes a much longer term process. Businesses seeking to improve on their current successes will often be charged less, because, compliant businesses receiving our services will often require less time and effort.</p>
